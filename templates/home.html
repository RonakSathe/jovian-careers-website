      <p  class="lead"> As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how           their products and services use it. Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a                 component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
